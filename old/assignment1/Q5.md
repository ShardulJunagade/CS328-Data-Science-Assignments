# Question 5

Q5. Suppose you have a population of 1 million people, out of which at least 1% are coffee drinkers. You want to get the estimate of this fraction by using sampling. Give the algorithm and the estimate. What kind of error bounds can you give with probability 99%?

## Solution

### Algorithm for Estimating Fraction of Coffee Drinkers

1. **Random Sampling**: Randomly sample $n$ people from the population of 1 million.
2. **Compute Sample Proportion**: 
    - Let $X_i$ be the indicator random variable for the $i$-th person in the sample. $X_i = 1$ if the person drinks coffee, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The number of coffee drinkers in the sample is given by:
    $$
    X = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
    $$
    - The estimate of the fraction of coffee drinkers in the population is given by:
    $$
    \hat{p} = \frac{X}{n}
    $$

    - Let $p$ be the true fraction of coffee drinkers in the population. The expected value of $\hat{p}$ is given by:
    $$
    E[\hat{p}] = p
    $$

3. **Error Bounds**: Use Chernoff bounds to find the error bounds for the estimate with probability 99%.


### Error Bounds using Chernoff Bounds

We want to find the error bounds for the estimate $\hat{p}$ with probability 99%. We can do this using Chernoff's double (two-sided) bound by combining the upper and lower tail bounds.

Let $p>0.01$ be the true fraction of coffee drinkers in the population and $n$ be the sample size. $X \sim Binomial(n, p)$ is the number of coffee drinkers in the sample.

-  Upper Tail Bound: $\space P(X \geq (1 + \delta)\mu) \leq e^{-\frac{\delta^2 \mu}{2 + \delta}}$ for all $\delta > 0$;
-  Lower Tail Bound: $\space P(X \leq (1 - \delta)\mu) \leq e^{-\frac{\delta^2 \mu}{2}}$ for all $0<\delta<1$

Using Chernoff's double bound, we can write the error bounds as:
$$
P(|X - \mu| \geq \delta \mu) \leq 2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\delta^2 \mu}{2 + \delta}}
$$

Ddivide by $n$ inside the probability and substitute $\mu = np$ in the above equation to get the error bounds for the estimate $\hat{p}$:
$$
P(|\hat{p} - p| \geq \delta p) \leq 2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\delta^2 n p}{2 + \delta}}
$$

Let $\epsilon = \delta p$ be the error margin. So, the equation becomes:
$$
P(|\hat{p} - p| \geq \epsilon) \leq 2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\epsilon^2 n}{2 p + \epsilon}}
$$


### Finding Sample Size for 99% Probability

We want to find $\delta$ such that the confidence level is 99%. This means that the probability of error should be less than 1% ,i.e., $P(|\hat{p} - p| \geq \epsilon) \leq 0.01$. So, we need to find the minimum sample size $n$ such that the above inequality holds.
$$
2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\epsilon^2 n}{2 p + \epsilon}} \leq 0.01
$$
$$
 -\frac{\epsilon^2 n}{2 p + \epsilon} \leq ln(0.005) 
$$
$$
 n \geq ln(200) \cdot \frac{2 p + \epsilon}{\epsilon^2}   
$$

**Example 1:**
We know that $p>0.01$ and taking an example of $\epsilon = 0.01$, we can find the minimum sample as follows:
$$
 n \geq ln(200) \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 0.01 + 0.01}{0.01^2} = 1589.4952099644 \approx 1590
$$

So, we need a sample size of at least 1590 to estimate the fraction of coffee drinkers in the population with a 99% confidence level and an error margin of 1%.


**Example 2:**
If we want a smaller error margin, say $\epsilon = 0.05$, then the minimum sample size required would be:
$$
 n \geq ln(200) \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 0.01 + 0.05}{0.05^2} = 148.3528862633 \approx 149
$$

So, we need a sample size of at least 149 to estimate the fraction of coffee drinkers in the population with a 99% confidence level and an error margin of 5%.
